# Practice Project written by Dyel
###### 2018-04-06
###### Version 0.2.2

This Project is written by beginners who have studied IoT but have a dream to become an web programmer. So it is composed of various topics and is fragmentary.

 - __Algorithm__ Have not learned about algorithms in college, I am learning through various books.
 - _(new)_ __ComputerEngineering__ A directory containing basic information about computer engineering.
 - __docs__ The planning intent was to assemble a variety of documents, but they will move to their respective directories, which will only write documents related to the main project. The directory that needs cleanup will be fixed in the near future. 
 - __IoT__ This directory is for the general purpose IoT platform.
 - __JS__ It is my favorite language (and most difficult). because it is asynchronous and can use from the backend to the front-end. Now I'm studying ES5, but the world is ES6/ES7. This directory covers from a variety of frameworks such as Node.js, Vue.js and MongoDB, to a variety of tools such as babel and webpack.
 - __Linux__ Directory for linux.
 - _(new)_ __ProblemSolving__ A directory that tries to solve various problems given.
    - __CUP__ Writing code for various programming competitions and developing problem-solving skills.
    - __REQ__ The code written at the request of a friend. So it has nothing to do with the main project.

 - __Project__ The planning intent was to assemble a variety of project, but they will move to their respective directories.The directory that needs cleanup will be fixed in the near future. 
 - __Python__ Writing various code using Python. Intuitive code with indentation, interpreter, and various libraries are interesting.
