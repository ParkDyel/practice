# ProjectName
  ## E:atmosphere

### Description

This project is to make a robot that will improve the quality of people's life. The function included in this robot is analyzing atmosphere and express through four different facial expressions: smile, no expression, frowning and sad.
The reason I came up with this idea is because I wanted to put robot and environmental problems together and by using dot-matrix it will show results of analysis. This robot will analyze temperature and humidity. Also the robot will be keep moving to inform people about information of current atmosphere. In order to make this function work, I also needed the ultra sonic sensor to calculate the distances between walls.
